# AI Governance Engineer — Troubleshooting

---

## Lab 1: Prompt Lineage causes a production incident

**Scenario**  
A production team reports a problem around **model lineage** in a system centered on **audit stores**. The issue is now affecting delivery confidence for the **AI Governance Engineer** role.

**Symptoms**  
- Latency, reliability, or correctness regressed in a way product teams can feel.
- Engineering dashboards show ambiguity rather than a single obvious root cause.
- Multiple teams are asking whether the problem is platform, application, model, security, or cost related.

**Impact**  
The role owner must restore service while preserving trust, safety, and a path to long-term prevention.

**Initial assumptions**  
- The first visible symptom may not identify the true control boundary.
- At least one upstream or downstream dependency is involved.
- A rollback might reduce impact faster than a perfect diagnosis.

**What to check first**  
1. Confirm scope: tenant, model, workflow, cluster, region, or customer.
2. Identify whether the failure centers on **auditability** or only looks that way.
3. Compare current behavior to the last known good configuration or release.

**Commands / evidence to gather**  
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl logs deploy/app -n platform --tail=100
curl -vk https://service.internal/health
jq . < event.json
```

**Logs / Metrics / Traces**  
- Logs should reveal the earliest component that lost a valid assumption.
- Metrics should tell you whether the system is saturated, blocked, or simply wrong.
- Traces should identify which hop introduced delay or incorrect behavior.

**Likely root causes**  
- Misconfigured **audit stores** integration or rollout drift.
- Hidden dependency contention caused by **auditability** design trade-offs.
- Security, policy, or quota changes that were technically correct but operationally destabilizing.

**Investigation flow**  
Start at the user-visible symptom, then walk inward toward the first shared control boundary. Do not jump straight to the deepest infrastructure layer unless evidence points there. Validate whether this is a correctness problem, a capacity problem, a dependency problem, or a bad deployment.

**Resolution**  
Prefer the fastest reversible mitigation first: rollback, disable a risky path, route to a safer fallback, reduce concurrency, or tighten permissions depending on what preserves safety and service best.

**Validation**  
Prove recovery using:
- healthy request success rates
- restored latency envelope
- no further authorization or data-integrity violations
- stable metrics for at least one normal traffic cycle

**Prevention**  
- Add a guardrail or preflight check for **model lineage**.
- Improve observability so this failure becomes diagnosable faster.
- Add release gates, quotas, or policy tests before the next rollout.

**Senior engineer considerations**  
A senior engineer does not stop at "what broke." They ask why the surrounding architecture allowed this class of failure to become user-visible without earlier containment.

- Misconfigured **policy engines** integration or rollout drift.
- Hidden dependency contention caused by **governance** design trade-offs.
- Security, policy, or quota changes that were technically correct but operationally destabilizing.

**Investigation flow**  
Start at the user-visible symptom, then walk inward toward the first shared control boundary. Do not jump straight to the deepest infrastructure layer unless evidence points there. Validate whether this is a correctness problem, a capacity problem, a dependency problem, or a bad deployment.

**Resolution**  
Prefer the fastest reversible mitigation first: rollback, disable a risky path, route to a safer fallback, reduce concurrency, or tighten permissions depending on what preserves safety and service best.

**Validation**  
Prove recovery using:
- healthy request success rates
- restored latency envelope
- no further authorization or data-integrity violations
- stable metrics for at least one normal traffic cycle

**Prevention**  
- Add a guardrail or preflight check for **prompt lineage**.
- Improve observability so this failure becomes diagnosable faster.
- Add release gates, quotas, or policy tests before the next rollout.

**Senior engineer considerations**  
A senior engineer does not stop at "what broke." They ask why the surrounding architecture allowed this class of failure to become user-visible without earlier containment.

## Lab 13: Prompt Lineage causes a production incident

**Scenario**  
A production team reports a problem around **model lineage** in a system centered on **audit stores**. The issue is now affecting delivery confidence for the **AI Governance Engineer** role.

**Symptoms**  
- Latency, reliability, or correctness regressed in a way product teams can feel.
- Engineering dashboards show ambiguity rather than a single obvious root cause.
- Multiple teams are asking whether the problem is platform, application, model, security, or cost related.

**Impact**  
The role owner must restore service while preserving trust, safety, and a path to long-term prevention.

**Initial assumptions**  
- The first visible symptom may not identify the true control boundary.
- At least one upstream or downstream dependency is involved.
- A rollback might reduce impact faster than a perfect diagnosis.

**What to check first**  
1. Confirm scope: tenant, model, workflow, cluster, region, or customer.
2. Identify whether the failure centers on **auditability** or only looks that way.
3. Compare current behavior to the last known good configuration or release.

**Commands / evidence to gather**  
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl logs deploy/app -n platform --tail=100
curl -vk https://service.internal/health
jq . < event.json
```

**Logs / Metrics / Traces**  
- Logs should reveal the earliest component that lost a valid assumption.
- Metrics should tell you whether the system is saturated, blocked, or simply wrong.
- Traces should identify which hop introduced delay or incorrect behavior.

**Likely root causes**  
- Misconfigured **audit stores** integration or rollout drift.
- Hidden dependency contention caused by **auditability** design trade-offs.
- Security, policy, or quota changes that were technically correct but operationally destabilizing.

- Latency, reliability, or correctness regressed in a way product teams can feel.
- Engineering dashboards show ambiguity rather than a single obvious root cause.
- Multiple teams are asking whether the problem is platform, application, model, security, or cost related.

**Impact**  
The role owner must restore service while preserving trust, safety, and a path to long-term prevention.

**Initial assumptions**  
- The first visible symptom may not identify the true control boundary.
- At least one upstream or downstream dependency is involved.
- A rollback might reduce impact faster than a perfect diagnosis.

**What to check first**  
1. Confirm scope: tenant, model, workflow, cluster, region, or customer.
2. Identify whether the failure centers on **governance** or only looks that way.
3. Compare current behavior to the last known good configuration or release.

**Commands / evidence to gather**  
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl logs deploy/app -n platform --tail=100
curl -vk https://service.internal/health
jq . < event.json
```

**Logs / Metrics / Traces**  
- Logs should reveal the earliest component that lost a valid assumption.
- Metrics should tell you whether the system is saturated, blocked, or simply wrong.
- Traces should identify which hop introduced delay or incorrect behavior.

**Likely root causes**  
- Misconfigured **policy engines** integration or rollout drift.
- Hidden dependency contention caused by **governance** design trade-offs.
- Security, policy, or quota changes that were technically correct but operationally destabilizing.

**Investigation flow**  
Start at the user-visible symptom, then walk inward toward the first shared control boundary. Do not jump straight to the deepest infrastructure layer unless evidence points there. Validate whether this is a correctness problem, a capacity problem, a dependency problem, or a bad deployment.

**Resolution**  
Prefer the fastest reversible mitigation first: rollback, disable a risky path, route to a safer fallback, reduce concurrency, or tighten permissions depending on what preserves safety and service best.

**Validation**  
Prove recovery using:
- healthy request success rates
- restored latency envelope
- no further authorization or data-integrity violations
- stable metrics for at least one normal traffic cycle

**Prevention**  
- Add a guardrail or preflight check for **prompt lineage**.
- Improve observability so this failure becomes diagnosable faster.
- Add release gates, quotas, or policy tests before the next rollout.

**Senior engineer considerations**  
A senior engineer does not stop at "what broke." They ask why the surrounding architecture allowed this class of failure to become user-visible without earlier containment.

## Lab 25: Prompt Lineage causes a production incident

**Scenario**  
A production team reports a problem around **model lineage** in a system centered on **audit stores**. The issue is now affecting delivery confidence for the **AI Governance Engineer** role.

**Symptoms**  
- Latency, reliability, or correctness regressed in a way product teams can feel.
- Engineering dashboards show ambiguity rather than a single obvious root cause.
- Multiple teams are asking whether the problem is platform, application, model, security, or cost related.
